                    the player will consume various sushi that represent numbers and mathematical operators. The consumed sushi then forms a mathematical equation that the player must solve at the end</p></div>

                    <p>The purpose of the game is to promote mental math for younger kids with basic math operations. The group and I were able to develop a fully functional game without previous Unity knowledge within just two days,
                        and we learned to worked together, to delegate tasks effectively, and to work under a tight schedule.</p>
