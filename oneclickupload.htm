                    Currently, the app only implements two social media APIs (Facebook and Twitter).</p></div>
                <div class="subcell"><p>
                    Android's built-in database, SQLite, is utilized in the app to persist user data such as Upload Profiles, preventing the loss of user created profiles between app closes.
                    When the app is opened, the profile information is then retrieved from the database and being unmarshalled into objects for use.</p></div>
